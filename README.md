# MoneyMap

Navigate your financial future with MoneyMap - an application for long-term financial planning. Input your income and expenses, then simulate your financial situation over time.

## Features

We're in MVP stage, so the features are basic:

- Input monthly income and expenses
- Simulate yearly financial status including balance, income, and expenses
- Store data in local storage for persistence
- Visualize financial projections with charts and graphs
- Interest calculations
- Debt calculations
- Adjusting expenses and income for inflation

## Future plans

- Income tax calculations with brackets
- Amortization schedules
- Multi-entity support (e.g. business and personal finances) with taxed transfers
- Templates for common financial scenarios
- Automatic FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) calculations

## Non-goals

- Detailed portfolio management. This tool is focused on cash flow and basic financial planning, not on managing investments.
- Data sale: financial data will never be used for any purpose except providing the planning functionality.
