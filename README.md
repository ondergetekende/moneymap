# Financial Planner - MVP

An application to do long-term financial planning. It allows users to input their income and expenses, and then simulates their financial situation over time.

## Features

We're in MVP stage, so the features are basic:

- Input monthly income and expenses
- Simulate yearly financial status including balance, income, and expenses
- Store data in local storage for persistence
- Visualize financial projections with charts and graphs
- Interest calculations

## Future plans

- Income tax calculations with brackets
- Debt management and amortization schedules
- Adjusting expenses and income for inflation
- Multi-entity support (e.g. business and personal finances) with taxed transfers
- Templates for common financial scenarios
- Automatic FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) calculations

## Non-goals

- Investment advice. This is purely a planning tool, we assume you know the consequences of your investment choices.
- Real-time market data integration. All calculations are based on user input and static assumptions.
- Monetization. This project is open-source and free to use. The furthest we may go is donations or non-intrusive ads. Financial data will never be used for any purpose except providing the planning functionality.
